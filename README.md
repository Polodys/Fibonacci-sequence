# Generalized Fibonacci Sequence

## Description

This project creates and displays a generalized Fibonacci sequence from data given by the user : the first two terms of the sequence and the number of terms. An input validation ensures that only integers are given.

## Features

- Input for the first two terms of the sequence and its length (at least 3 terms)
- Dynamic display of the sequence in a numbered list
- Validation of data entered by the user, with message displayed in case of error

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the project
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for the logic of the Fibonacci sequence and for user interaction
